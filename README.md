# Beyond Geo-Localization

**BGL (Beyond Geo-Localization)** is a method that aims to improve the granularity of the orienation extraction of query street-view imagery in large-scale search via cross-view matching with satellite images. Giving a query street-view imagery with no prior knowledge of its location, the method checks its similarity to a pool of candidate satellite imagery and find the best-matched location and orientation as the extraction result. A paper [**Beyond Geo-localization: Fine-grained Orientation of Street-view Images by Cross-view Matching with Satellite Imagery**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3503161.3548102) has been published in ACM MultiMedia 2022. More supplimentary materials can be found in the [**arXiv Version**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03398.pdf). Addtionally a follow up work [**PetalView: Fine-grained Location and Orientation Extraction of Street-view Images via Cross-view Local Search**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3581783.3612007) proposed new method for fine-grained orientation and location extraction at sub-degree and sub-meter granularity.
